# HyperSDT
This is the implementation and experiment results of the paper "HyperSDT: HyperNetwork Slide Decision Tree for
Interpretable Tabular Learning".

The implementation of HyperSDT in the original paper is `bin/HyperSDT.py`.

## How to test your model

You can test your models by adding them to `bin` directory and `bin/__init__.py`. Keep the same API we used in other models, and write your own evaluation script (`run_HyperSDT.py` as a reference).
